# Whistles

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whistle>

-   Each whistle has a key, for example D, C or G. This means that each whistle has limited only certain notes it can play (without advanced techniques). Those notes are stored in the lists in the starter.

-   Notes are just alphabet characters A-G with optional symbol `#` to indicate if it's a "sharp" note. Ex: `C#` is different from `C`.


## Questions

Use python's `set` datatype to answer the following:

-   Can G be played on all three whistles?

-   What is are the notes in common in the C whistle and the D whistle?

-   What is are the notes are in E that are not in D?

-   What are all the playable notes?


# Tunes

A tune (in the starter) is just a list of notes and associated duration. For example `('A', 2)` means play the A note for a duration of 2 beats.


## Questions

Use python's  `set` datatype  to answer the following:

-   What notes are part of the reel?

-   Which whistles are able to play the reel? Note that the whistle can play both uppercase and lowercase notes, ex: D whistle can play both "F#" and "f#".


# (Optional) Playing the scales/tune.

Call the function `play` to hear the scale or tune. But you'll have to install the dependencies (`pygame` and `midiutil`) first.
